Hello and welcome to my homepage!

I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at [The Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability](https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, where I am very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Wolfram Schlenker](https://wolfram-schlenker.info/) and Prof. [Charles Taylor](https://ca-taylor.com/). I hold a BA (Honors) in Economics from Minzu University of China and an MA in Social Science-Economics from the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. You could find my CV [here](/files/CV (1).pdf). My research interests lie in the field of environmental economics, labor economics and IO. 

I am a first-generation college student (I am also the only person in my immediate family that has attended any type of post secondary). And I am grateful to Minzu University of China for funding my visiting to UC Berkeley in 2022 through the *Scholarship to Visit Top Universities in the World*, where I found my interest in economics research and planned to pursue a PhD program in economics. Feel free to reach out, I’m always happy to chat!
